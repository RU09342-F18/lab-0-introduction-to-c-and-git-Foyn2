# Lab 0: Introduction to C and Git By Nolan Foy

The first lab of the semester involved a quick introduction to both the C programming
language and the Github application. We were tasked with the basic creation of a user-defined
function which would have the ability to do the basic math functions in the program. The 
math operations included in the math function are as follows:

 (+) ADD (num1 + num2)

 (-) Subtract (num1 - num2)

 (*) Multiply (num1 * num2)

 (/) Divide (num1/num2)

 (%) Modulus (num1 % num2)

 (<) Left Shift (num1 << num2)

 (>) Right Shift (num1 >> num2)

 (&) Bitwise AND (num1 & num2)

 (|) Bitwise OR (num1 * num2)

 (^) Bitwise XOR (num1 * num2)

 (~) Bitwise Inverse (~num1)

In the math.c file, cases were used to implement all of the math functions. By doing so, all of the operands were
able to be completed without making separate functions for all of them. In order to test my code, I used the compiler
provided in the slack. The results can be found in the math.c file uploaded

# Programs Used
The programs that I used were the github repository provided and Code Composer Studio. I obtained a .c file from Bracket Code
Editor and uploaded it to this respective repository. As mentioned above, the Coding Ground Compiler provided in slack was used to test the code.
